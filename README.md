# find-my-bunk
A web scraper written in Python and Typescript that displays information scraped from airbnb listings
Readmes are used as brain dumps until I complete the project and then I come back and make it shiny for other users.

Python backend for web scraper - Python 3.8.5
Typescript frontend for (hopefully) pretty display of data
MongoDB... Dynamo maybe for data storage
Host on AWS cause that's fun!

Packages installed:
- requests_html package : This library intends to make parsing HTML (e.g. scraping the web) as simple and intuitive as possible.
TL;DR - Access a URL and pull out the data from that page

MVP:
- Please write some code that scrapes property name, property type (e.g Apartment), number of bedrooms, bathrooms and list of the amenities.

Extensions:
- To dockerize this and make it MUCH MORE easier for installing all the requirements such as qt, cmake..
